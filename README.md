# nutrition-label-maker

## Description
Unity project for creating organic food labels

## Functionality
<ul>
<li>Create standard size document (choice of two different sizes)</li>
<li>Import and place an image</li>
<li>Place basic text boxes</li>
<li>Fill out a form to populate nutrition facts template - https://www.onlinelabels.com/label-generator-tools/nutrition-label-generator.aspx -- place on document</li>
<li>Fill out a form with ingredients and weight, that calculates percentages and orders list large-small -- place on document</li>
<li>Choice from organic labels -- place on document</li>
<li>Export document as PNG or PDF </li>
</ul>

## Progress
The nutrition facts generator is nearly completed. This creates a form does the math to display a properly formatted nutrition facts label. The only thing missing is the vitamins and minerals portion. 
The ability to browse and import graphics at runtime is working. I need to add scale and position abilities, as well as lock down the maximum size available for import.
